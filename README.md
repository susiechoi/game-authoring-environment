    - to select a new image in the image selectors, press enter after entering the name of the new file

## Impressions

Getting started with the project was one of the most challenging parts of it - after the pretty narrowly defined specifications of the previous projects, it was difficult to adjust to a more open-ended project. Perhaps easing into the freedom (by giving fewer exact specifications in previous projects) would have eased the transition.
