# User Testing Notes

- overwhelmed by lots of screens
    - what are they all doing?? have to edit shooting of tower after menu
- error checking for apply is weird
- massive blocks when on dragboard
    - would be nice if close to same size
- need confirmation with apply/save
    - onclick something
- don't know which is default tower, which is named tower - tower labels
- get rid of default tower if user creates a tower
- tower placing not exactly where you want it
- pause doesn't work
- way too many screens, need to make them more intuitive
- the tower jumps when placed
- ability to drop mulitple towers at once?
- make more clear what start/path/end blockser
- drag and drop to trash 
- click to select?
- clear button
- undo
- make game creation flow more easy?
    - ie what should you make first, make second - minimize potential flow errors
